# Retro gaming

I built a bartop with a Raspberry Pi and old LCD screen from broken laptop.

I bought a display adapter from ebay.

I will try to make my own 8 bit retro game. I found [this channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrGvkDImwWQxWyTOo6r3Pyw) that will probably help me.

TAS \(Tool assisted speedruns\) use tool to realize the best speedrun of a game. It is often done for retro games but can be done for more recent games if tools are available.
