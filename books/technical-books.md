## The Clean Coder

The main purpose of this book is to remind you what is a good programmer and how he is supposed to do his work with the best manneers. The author, uncle Bob Martin, shares its own experience as a programmer and delivers goos tips according differents situation we are exposed during our office hours \(and more\): When you can say yes, when it is your job to say no, why is it important to work hard even when you are out of office,  and so more. 

Even if a lot of tips seem very logical, I think it is important to have words for these situations. It helped me to progress to be comme a better programmer. 

## Clean Code

Maybe the reference book for writing good and clean code ! A lot of good advices more or less easy to apply all the time when you code. 

## Clean architecture

Similar to Clean Code, it extends the purpose to an bigger view than only code. It follows more or less the same ideas to improve code and architecture. You will still found some of SOLID principles that can be applied to architecture.
