# Java

Maybe ont of the best back-end language : 

* Very popular
* Old =&gt; less buggy than others
* Strict typing = easier to debug
* Really fast, especially today with all the cheap memory resources 

### Streams

With java streams, it's easier to manipulate arrays. I often use map, filter and reduce.
