# Java

Maybe one of the most used back-end language : 

* Very popular
* Old =&gt; probably less buggy than more recent languages
* Strict typing = easier to debug
* Really fast, especially today with all the cheap memory resources, if well optimized, can be awesome

### Streams

With java streams, it's easier to manipulate arrays. I often use map, filter and reduce.
