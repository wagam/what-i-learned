# How to create an Angular app

See [Angular doc](https://angular.io) for more infos.

I watch a lot of John Papa's blog and videos. He brings good practices.

## Install Angular CLI

You need to have npm \(or yarn\) installed. Then in your terminal:

```
$ npm i -g @angular/cli
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 -g is for global
{% endhint %}

## Init app

When it's done, tou can create a new app with:

```
ng init
```

## Run your hello world app

```text
ng serve
```
