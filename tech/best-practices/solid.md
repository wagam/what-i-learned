# SOLID

SOLID is an acronym:

**Single Responsibility Principle** 

#### Open-Closed Principle <a id="61a6"></a>

#### Liskov Substitution Principle <a id="cacf"></a>

**Interface segregation** : a good interface brings you only what is necessary \(e.g. electric plug delivers you electricity and only that, you don't need to know electricity history or how the network is created\)

**Dependency Injection**
