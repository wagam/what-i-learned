# SOLID

SOLID is an acronym:

**Single Responsibility Principle** 

> You had one job.

A class should be responsible for only one thing. If a class has more than one responsibility, it becomes coupled. A change to one responsibility results to modification of the other responsibility

#### Open-Closed Principle <a id="61a6"></a>

> Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.

#### Liskov Substitution Principle <a id="cacf"></a>

> Parent classes should be easily substituted with their child classes without blowing up the application.

**Interface segregation** : a good interface brings you only what is necessary \(e.g. electric plug delivers you electricity and only that, you don't need to know electricity history or how the network is created\)

**Dependency Injection**

> **C**lasses should depend on abstraction but not on concretion.
