# CSS frameworks

When I start a new project, I use a design framework. It helps to develop fastly a clean interface with a good design.

## Bootstrap \(Twitter\)

One of the first CSS framework popularized with the 3.0 version released with simple rules to help to have a responsive template to start with.

Tip: Alternate class "col" and "row" for nested html tags. A row resets margins and paddings when a col adds some.
