# CSS frameworks

When I start a new project, I use a design framework.

## Bootstrap \(Twitter\)

One of the first CSS framework popularized with the 3.0 version released with simple rules to help to have a responsive template to start with.

Tip: Alternate class "col" and "row" for nested html tags. A row resets margins and paddings when a col adds some.

## Bulma

## Material \(Angular\)

Material Angular is the official framework to build angular apps with the Google design framework \(Material\).
