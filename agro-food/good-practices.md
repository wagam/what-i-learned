# Good to remember

I worked in agro food for almost 10 years. That's what I remember :

* Fat and carbs are not expensive but proteins are. Agro industry use a lot of fat and carbs.
* Avoid already prepared meals =&gt; a lot of sugar is hidden in that \(inverted sugar, dextrose, ...\)
* Nuggets are not really composed of chicken meat. It's more about bones and skins melted and reduced, added with chicken flavour.
* Avoid first prices meals
* Meat will become more and more expensive, because of China growth and EU lower grants.
