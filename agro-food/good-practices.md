# Good to remember

I worked in agro food for almost 10 years. That's what I remember :

* Fat and carbs are not expensive but proteins are. Agro industry use a lot of fat and carbs.
* Avoid already prepared meals =&gt; a lot of sugar is hidden in that \(inverted sugar, dextrose, ...\)
* Nuggets are not really composed of chicken meat. It's more about bones and skins melted and reduced, added with chicken flavor.
* Avoid first prices meals, it is often not very nutritional. Prefer mid or high prices meals. 
* Meat will become more and more expensive, because of China growth and EU lower grants.
* Don't be obsessed with expiration dates. Industries has to protect themselves. They don't want you ti die because of their products. So, they reduce de expiration date to be sure it's ok to eat it. Dry food, as pastas, powder soups, cans, yogurts can be eaten a long time after the date, just be cautious with some weird stuff : if cans are abnormally inflated, or if something smells bad, DON'T EAT IT. 
* Every ingredient could possibly be toxic if it exceed a toxic limit, even the water!

## Yuka

Yuka is an app giving nutritional informations about food product. If the product is not ok, it can proposes better alternatives. But as every application, algorithms have some bias and depend on the rules given in entry. So it is important to take a step back. It is normal if cakes have a lot of carbs. We know it and we buy them for that. That's why when Yuka says it is not healthy because it has too much carbs, it is a fact. But it is not really a problem if you eat some. And it doesn't take into account at the moment what you have eaten before.

Again, saying some ingredients are not safe like titanium dioxide or preservatives is a good alert, but it is not really a problem to eat them. Because of the laws, agro food industries cannot use them more than certain limit. And a lot of studies have been done before to be sure it is not toxic.

That's why I think, Yuka is a good app, but has not to become your ultimate reference when you want to buy food.
