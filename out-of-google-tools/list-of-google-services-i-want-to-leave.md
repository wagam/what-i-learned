# List of Google services I want to leave

### Google Search Engine

Replaced by DuckDuckGO

### Google Chrome

Replaced by [Firefox and Vivaldi](../tools/browsers/)

#### Google Drive

I started using nextcloud but I did not jump to it totally. Google sheets with real time edition are really killer features

#### Gmail

#### Android

I have LineageOS on my OnePlus5 but it still has built-in Google apps with \(maps, music, ...\)
