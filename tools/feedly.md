# Feedly

I don't want to lose time to find good tech articles and to stay up to date with tech news and trends. I tried few RSS readers. The best for me at this moment is Feedly. I can add RSS feed and bookmark any website in categories. 

Good point is it has Android app and FeedlyBoard chrome extension.
