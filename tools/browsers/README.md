# Browsers

I use two web browsers on my computer: Vivaldi and Firefox.

### Vivaldi \(for dev stuff\)

I use Vivaldi because it's Chromium based and the dev console is really powerful and customizable. Why not Chrome? Because I don't want to share all my data with Google.

### Firefox \(for personal surf\)

I use Firefox to keep my privacy. Since last year and big update, Firefox is faster and better but the main lack is dev tool console. If it becomes as good as the chromium one, I will do the definitive switch.
