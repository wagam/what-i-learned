# Browsers

I use two web browsers on my computer: Vivaldi and Firefox.

### Vivaldi \(for dev stuff\)

I use Vivaldi because it's Chromium based and the dev console is really powerful and customizable. Why not Chrome? Because I don't want to share all my data with Google.

### Firefox \(for personal surf\)

I use Firefox to keep my privacy. Since last year and big update, Firefox is faster and better.
