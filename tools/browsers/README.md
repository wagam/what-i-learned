# Browsers

I use two web browsers on my computer: Vivaldi and Firefox.

### Vivaldi \(for dev stuff\)

I use Vivaldi because it's Chromium based and the dev console is really powerful and customizable. Why not Chrome? Because I don't want to share all my data with Google. A small cool feature is the possibility to see the differents CSS layouts and theirs limits directly on the current page. It helps to see if things are aligned, the real place they are using and the html tag superposition.

### Firefox \(for personal surf and CSS debugging\)

I use Firefox to keep my privacy. Since last year and big update, Firefox is faster and better but the main lack is dev tool console. If it becomes as good as the chromium one, I will do the definitive switch.

Firefox has improved its developper tools and especially for the CSS part. You can now see how CSS grid works on your page.
