# Browser extensions

### uBlock origin

Best ad blocker at the moment. Wait to see if it will work in future chromium versions.

### LastPassManager

Used to store my passwords.

### PrivacyBadger

Helps to keep my privacy. In a new website, I open the extension and turn off all ad trackers \(usually contains ad in its URL... \)

### Video Speed Controller

Add controls to adjust speed on web video players. I use it often with Netflix to speed up TV shows. Speed around 1.6 is ok to follow dialogs.

### Feedly board \(chrome-like only\)

Helps to save a website and /or a specific link to one of your Feedly board.
